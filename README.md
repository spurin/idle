Ever needed a container that does absolutely nothing, but does it really well? Meet **Idle**, the ultimate minimalist container designed to idle indefinitely with elegance. Lightweight, multi-arch, low level and optimized, it's like the Zen master of containers - perfect for Kubernetes experiments, testing, or just hanging out in your cluster.

## Features

- **Ultra-Lightweight**: Runs on a `scratch` base, with binaries so small you‚Äôll wonder where they went
- **Purposefully Pointless**: It‚Äôs not lazy - it‚Äôs just really good at waiting
- **Multi-Arch Zen**: Built for every architecture you can think of (probably)
- **Graceful SIGINT/SIGTERM Handling**: Shuts down cleanly when your cluster tells it to go
- **Prebuilt for the Impatient**: Grab it straight from Docker Hub and let it chill in your cluster

## Prebuilt Images: Ready to Sit and Stay üêæ

Prebuilt images are available on Docker Hub as `spurin/idle`. They support the following architectures, so your cluster nodes can all feel included:

- `linux/amd64`
- `linux/386`
- `linux/arm64/v8`
- `linux/arm/v7`
- `linux/arm/v6`
- `linux/ppc64le`
- `linux/s390x`

## Run it in Docker

```
docker run --rm spurin/idle:latest
```

## Kubernetes? Why Not?

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: idle
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: idle
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: idle
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: idle
        image: spurin/idle:latest
```

## How It Works: A Masterclass in Doing Nothing

Idle is written in minimalist C. It includes graceful handling of SIGINT/SIGTERM signals for a clean shutdown, ensuring it's a well-behaved citizen in your Kubernetes cluster. The multi-stage Dockerfile:

1. Compiles C code with gcc and musl to remove unnecessary components
2. Statically links the code into a self-contained binary
3. Packs it into a scratch container for maximum minimalism

The program itself:

- Loops indefinitely with a 1-second nanosleep
- Listens for SIGINT/SIGTERM signals to gracefully exit when asked

## Why Use Idle?

- **For Testing and Debugging**: Need a placeholder container for your cluster? Idle‚Äôs got your back
- **Learn and Tinker**: Dive into multi-arch builds, assembly, and minimalist container design
- **Extreme Minimalism**: Impress your friends with a container that weighs less than your config files
- **Learning Multi-Stage Builds**: Demonstrates a clean, efficient container workflow
- **Cluster Ready**: Give your Kubernetes cluster something to meditate on

## About the Zen of Idle üßò

Idle isn‚Äôt just a container - it‚Äôs a philosophy. Sometimes, the best action is no action at all. Whether you‚Äôre testing workloads, experimenting with cluster scaling, or just need a pod to sit there and look pretty, Idle is here to remind you: less is more.
